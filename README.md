# Libft

## Description

**ft_printf** is a foundational project in the 42 curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to create very own implementation of the C function ft_printf.

Through this project, students learn:
- Low-level memory manipulation
- String handling
- Defensive programming in C
- Proper use of headers, Makefiles, and static libraries

The result is a reusable static library (`libft.a`) that provides reliable, well-tested helper functions.

## Instructions

### Compilation

In order to compile the library, just run:

```bash
make
```

## Resources 

**AI** is used to visualize memory and to understand C programming concepts, main functions that require in-depth testing.
